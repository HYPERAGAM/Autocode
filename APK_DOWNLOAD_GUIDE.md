   - Wait for build to complete
   - Click "locate" when build finishes

4. **Find Your APK:**
   - Location: `app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
   - This is your installable APK file!

### Option 2: Online Build Service
You can use online Android build services:

1. **GitHub Actions** (if you upload to GitHub)
2. **Bitrise** or **CircleCI** 
3. **Firebase App Distribution**

These services can build your APK in the cloud.

### Option 3: Use a Different Computer
If you have access to another computer with Android Studio:

Your final APK will be approximately:

## Alternative: Run in Browser
While I can't generate the APK without Android tools, I could create a web version of the app that runs in your browser. Would you like me to do that instead?
